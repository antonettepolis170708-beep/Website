You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
You know you want me
So don't keep sayin' our hands are tied

You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pullin' you miles away and out of a reach from me
But you're hearin' my heart
So who can stop me if I decide that you're my destiny?

What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothin' could keep us apart
You'll be the one I was meant to find

It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one could say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
And maybe the world could be ours, tonight

Ah-oh (no, no, no, no)
Ah-oh (mm)

You think it's easy
You think I don't wanna run to you, yeah
But there are mountains (but there are mountains)
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you're wondering why
Because we're able to be just you and me within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all

No one can rewrite the stars
How can you say you'll be mine?
Everythin' keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find (the one you were meant to find)
It's not up to you, it's not up to me (yeah)
When everyone tells us what we can be

And how can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours, tonight
All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible (it's not impossible)
Is it impossible?
Say that it's possible

And how do we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
And nothin' could keep us apart
'Cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one could say what we get to be

And why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changin' the world to be ours

Ay, ah-oh (no, no, no, no)
Ah-oh (mm)

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
But I can't have you
We're bound to break and my hands are tied
