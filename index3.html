            <h2><mark style="background-color: yellow;">Introduction</mark></h2>

            <p> <b>Handicraft</b> businesses <sup>encounter</sup> various technological <sup>challenges</sup> as they <sup>strive</sup> <i>to</i> <sup>keep</sup> pace with the rapid advancements in digital tools <i>e-commerce</i> <i>platforms</i> and other emerging technologies.These challenges often stem from integrating modern technological solutions without <sup>compromising</sup> <i>the</i> traditional craftsmanship that <sup>defines</sup> their products .</p>

            <br>
            <br><i>The</i> global handicraft industry faces variuos <sup>challenges</sup> in executing effetive promotional strategies <b>Artisans</b> often work within fragmented systems <sup>characterized</sup> by informal agreements and varying skill <del>levels,</del> making organized promotional efforts difficult (<b>Signh,</b> 2024). These difficulties are exacerbated by the indutry inherent complexity, wich spans multiple stage from organizational planning to catering to diverse markets. Flexibelity and adaptitability are cretical for businesses to navigate this complexities. Challenges are evident at all levels, wheter in policies, institutional support, or the practices of craftspeople themselves, <sup>understanding</sup> the collective struggles experienced on a global scale.
            <br>
            <br>Despites thier hardles, businesses within the handicaft sector can proactively navigate complexities by employing specific strategies. identifying target audiences creating unique brand image and <del>leveraging</del> social media to reach global markets are essential approches. In addition tailoring promotional mateials participating in industry events pathering with <del>local</del> vendors and emphasizing superior craftmanship can enhance market visibility. Understanding cultural norms prioritizing costumer satisfaction and using social media for interactive engagement are also critical for delivering an exceptional customer. By adopting these strategies a integrating them into cohesive promotional plan handicraft businesses can successfully promote their products on the international stage (<b>Signh,</b> 2024).
            <br>
            <br>While extensive research covers business adaption in urban settings and among <del>larger</del> enterprises there is notable research gap in understanding how small handicrafts businesses in rural or semi-rural areas <del>like</del> <b>Calbayog City</b> navigate modern economic changes contemporarry practices with traditional values have not been throughly explored.
            <br>
            <br>A study by <b>Galardi</b> et al. (2022), explores how small businesses in rural regions aapt traditional business models to contemporary economic environments. It highligths how these businesses integrate local customs and practices with modern technology and business strategies to address challenges such as <del>limited</del> market access and resources contraints. The study find that this blends of old and new approaches and enables businesses to remain competitive and resillient reflecting similar dynamics to those observed in <b>Calbayog City.</b>  <i>The</i> researchers also observed that as more machine-made alternatives to native products particularly in hanicrafts such as tables, chairs and home decor are introduced to the market it becomes inscreasingly difficult for native businesses to survive <del>leading</del> some to bankruptcy. This obsrevation was supposed by the initial interview conducted by the researchers with three of the handicraft entrepeneurs in Calbayog City they mentioned that it has become a challenge for them to adapt to these technological changes and stay competitive, wich <del>leads</del> to some customers shifting to cheaper machine-made alternatives. Because of these reasons the researcher are motivated explore the coping mechanism handicrafts enterpreneurs employ to navigate these technological challenges and remain competetive in the global marketplace.

            <br>
            <h2><mark style="background-color: yellow;">Theoritical Framework</mark></h2>
            <br>
            <br>This study is anchored on the organizational resilience theory by <b>Vogus</b> and <b>Sutclifffe</b> is understood as an organization that can anticipate, prepare for respond to and adpt to  both gradual change and sudden discruptions to survive and thrive. Its about building a culture that can withstand and adapt to disruptions, changes, and challenges while maintaining its core functions and objectives. Reselient organizations are better equipped to navigate disruptive changes such as technological advancements shifting market dynamics and unnexpected crises (<b>Vogus & Sutcliffe,</b> 2007). 
            <br>
            <br>Given the lemited empirical research on resillience within organizational theory there are numerous oppurtunities fo future exploration of this cocept, especially in the context of small businesses. One possible explanation for organizational resillience is availability of slack resources such as finanacial reserves, human capital, or conceptual slack (<b>Schulman,</b>1993) wich provide organizations with the flexibility needed to absorb shocks and adapt to change. These slack resources are essential to an organizations ability to cope with unnexpected challenges such as those brougth by technological disruptions.
            <br>
            <br>In relation to handicraft businesses facing technological <sup>challenges</sup> maintaining an up-to-date awareness of thier operational limits and availabe resources is critical.For handicraft businesses this margin could include to  access technology, skilled labor fenancial flexibility, wich allows them to adapt to technological innovations without overextending themselves. In the context of this study the ability of handicraft businesses in <b>Calbayog City</b> to maintain a sufficient marginof resources will be crucial in their efforts to navigate the technological challenges they face. Operating too close to this margin particularly in an era of rapid technological change, could expose businesses to significant risks, emphasizing the need for effective coping strategies.
            <br>
            <br>In support with the theory.The Dynamic Capabilities Theory proposed by Teece Pisano and <b>Shuen</b> (1997) focuses on an organization ability to integrate, develope, and reconfigure both internal and external resources and capabilities effectively respond to rapidly changing environments. This theory is particularly relevant to understanding the organizations such as handicraft businesses can adapt to technological challenges. It suggest that the businesses with strong dynamic capabilities are better positioned to recognize, absorb, and apply new technolgies or processes enabling them to stay competetive and resillient in a dynamic market.
            <br>
            <br>This aligns with the Resillience Theory, wich highligths the importance of maintaining flexibility and sufficient slack resources to cope with unexpected disruptions. Both theories emphasie this need for businesses to not only survive but also to thrive in the face of challenges. In the context of the current study on the coping mechanisms of handicraft businesses towards technological challenges, Dynamic Capabilities Theory supports the idea that businesses must continously envolve by enhancing their technological capabilities are resource management. This is esential for overcoming technological hurdles adn remaining competitive, especially in an environment where digital transformation and innovation are constantly reshaping the industry.
            <br>
            <br>By integrating the concept of dynamic capabilities with resilience, the study sugests that handicarft businesses, especially in <b>Calbayog City</b> must develop the capacity to continuously adapt technological changes. This involves building and reconfiguring bioth internal skills (such as digital literacy) and external resources (such as access to ecommerce platforms or supply chain emprovement) to ensure long-term businesses the study focus on adaptability but also reinforces the importance of having the resilience to manage and thrive despite technological disruptions.
            <br>
            <br>The Organizational Resillience Theory and Dynamic Capabilities. Theory are both highly relevant to understanding how handicraft businesses cope with technological challenges. Organizational Resellience Theory emphasize the ability of businesses to absorb shocks and adapt to discruptions by maintaining slack resources such as fenancial reserves, skilled labor or technological flexibility wich is crucial for continuing operations during challenging times. In the case of handicraft businesses in Calbayog City,this  theory helps explain how businesses manage limited resoirces and develop strategies to endure technological disruptions. On the other hand, Dynamic Capabilities Theory focuses on an organization ability to adapt and reconfigure internal an external resources in response <i>to</i> rapidly changing environments, highligthing <i>the</i> need for busineses <i>to</i> envolve through new technologies and innovations. For handicraft businesesses, this could involve adopting digital tools, enhancing prouction methods or tapping into e-commerce platforms to stay competetive.Together, these theories underscore the importance of adaptability and strategic flexibility in overcoming technological challenges. While resillience ensures that businesses can weather disruptions, dynamics capabilities enable them to actively transform and innovate ensuring long-term growth and survival in an increasingly digital world. This dual framework provides a comprehensive understanding of how handicraft businesses can not only cope with, but also thrive in, the face of technological change.
